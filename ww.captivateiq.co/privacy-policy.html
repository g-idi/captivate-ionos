(“<strong>Company</strong>”) know you care about how your Personal Information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following Privacy Policy to learn more about how we use and share your Personal Information.</p><p>By using or accessing the Services in any manner or by providing Personal Information to us, you acknowledge the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby consent to our collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information as set forth herein.</p><p>Remember that your use of Company’s Services is at all times subject to the Terms and Conditions, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms and Conditions.</p><h2>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h2><p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of “personal information,” “personal data,” and other similar terms under applicable data protection laws  (collectively, &quot;Personal Information&quot;) that we gather in the course of our business, including on our website, our sales commission platform, and our related online and offline offerings. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our website, sales commission platform, and related offerings are collectively called the “Services.”  </p><p>We gather various types of Personal Information from our users and other individuals, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to provide, personalize, and improve our Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties as described below.</p><p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that our customers provide to us to be processed on their behalf (“Customer Data”). Our customers are responsible for providing the appropriate notice to individuals and obtaining any required authorizations to permit us to process Customer Data. Our customers’ respective privacy policies will govern the collection and use of such information and we encourage you to read each customer’s privacy policy in detail. Our use of Customer Data is governed by a separate agreement we have with each customer.</p><p>In addition, if you use the Services on behalf of an organization (e.g., your employer), your Personal Information may be subject to that organization’s privacy policy. In such cases, Company’s use of your Personal Information may be governed by the agreement we have with that organization, but we will still process your information consistent with this Privacy Policy. <br/></p><h2>WILL COMPANY EVER CHANGE THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</h2><p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, or as otherwise required by applicable law. Please note that if you haven’t provided us with your email address, these legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you continue to use the Services after the new Privacy Policy takes effect.</p><h2>WHAT INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</h2><h4>Information You Provide to Us:</h4><p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process, through your account settings, through interactive features on the Services (e.g., the chat feature on our website), through interacting with our customer support, or if you apply for a job with Company, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Salesforce or other third party sites). We may also collect Personal Information from individuals and third parties to assess and pursue potential business opportunities.</p><p>If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“<strong>Third Party Account Information</strong>”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.</p><h4>Information Collected Automatically:</h4><p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information, which may include your IP address, geolocation data (including inferred location based off your IP address), details about your device and/or browser, “cookie” information, the page or feature you requested, and information about how you interact with and use the Services. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded. Our advertising partners, if any, may also transmit cookies and other similar technologies to your browser or device, to tailor and deliver advertisements. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p><p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to provide and improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.<br/></p><h4>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy:</h4><p>Through certain third party cookies we place on your browser or device, our service providers may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to provide and improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including personalized advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.</p><h4>Analytics:</h4><p><strong>‍</strong>We may use third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to grow our business, to provide, improve, and develop our Services, to monitor and analyze use of our Services, to aid our technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to verify that users have the authorization needed for us to process their requests. These services may collect and retain some information about you. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you use the Services, but does not collect any information that can, by itself, identify you in the real world. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you use the Services, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your use of the Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google Analytics at<a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/"> www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.
